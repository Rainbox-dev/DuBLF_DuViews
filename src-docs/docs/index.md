Welcome to the official *DuViews* documentation.

DuViews is a very simple addon for *Blender* which adds items in the *Window* menu and a new pie menu to quickly open new windows with a single space, from anywhere in *Blender*. It is very useful when you temporarily need to work in a specific area for example, but you want to keep your current workspace as it is.
